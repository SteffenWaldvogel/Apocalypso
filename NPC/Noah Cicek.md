His father Roberto—a high‐level Runeseeker himself, heavily touched by the Void—sees Noah’s burgeoning Echo Evolution as the key to greater power. Under Roberto’s stern tutelage, Noah studies his mutation’s echoes by day, while at night he wrestles with the fear of becoming merely a tool in his father’s designs.  
- **Appearance:** slender build, pale skin, short black hair, grey eyes; always wears the glowing Mother’s Mark amulet
