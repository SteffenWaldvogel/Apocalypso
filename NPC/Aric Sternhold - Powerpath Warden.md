| **Final Verdict**      | Ultimate Active | Condemns all foes in view: each must make a DC 25 Wisdom save or fall unconscious for 1 turn. Undead and constructs auto‐fail.             | Instant      | 100 Mana     | Count 0 / Threshold 10   |

| **System’s Favor**     | Passive/Reaction| Once per turn, as a reaction, negate any one incoming effect (spell, critical hit, trap) by expending 10 Mana.                             | Reaction     | 10 Mana      | Count 0 / Threshold 10   |

## 7. Roleplaying Notes
- **Mannerisms:** Speaks in clipped, formal tones. Never raises his voice, but every word carries weight.  
- **Motivation:** To guide worthy candidates through the choice and enforce the System’s integrity above all else.  
- **Weakness:** His unwavering devotion means he cannot bend rules—even if that endangers himself or his charges.
