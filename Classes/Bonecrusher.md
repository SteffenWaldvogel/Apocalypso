## Class Tier  
Mid-Specialization Advancement

## Role  
Brutal Control Tank / Frontline Demolisher (Knockdowns, Breaking Armor, Terrain Disruption)

## Description  
Bonecrushers donâ€™t rush blindly into battle.  
They **collapse** it around their enemies.

With every hit, a leg shatters, a shield breaks, or a will falters.  
They know exactly where to hit for maximum devastationâ€”and they love doing it.

You don't need to be fast when you can make everything else slower.

> **The bigger they are, the better they break.**
