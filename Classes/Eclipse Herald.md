Advanced Tier

## Role  
Control / Psychological Overlord (Illusions, Fear Propagation, Battlefield Corruption)

## Description  
The Eclipse Herald no longer whispers doubts into the minds of foes.  
They **erase certainty** itself.

Reality bends at their passing.  
Allies feel strengthened by the oppressive night.  
Enemies, unsure what is real, collapse under phantom threats and impossible horrors.

There is no battlefield.  
Only fear, and those wise enough to serve it.
