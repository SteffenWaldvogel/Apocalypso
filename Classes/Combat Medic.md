Support (Battlefield Healing, Buffing, Tactical Intervention)

## Description  
Graduating from the chaos of triage, the Combat Medic becomes a front-line specialist. With adrenaline boosters in one hand and contaminated blades in the other, they navigate the razor-thin line between preservation and power. Their healing is faster, their methods harsher‚Äîand their decisions, irreversible.

Combat Medics are no longer just responders. They are strategists of survival, shaping life and death in real-time.
