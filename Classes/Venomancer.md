## Class Tier  
Mid Tier Advancement

## Role  
Support / Damage-over-Time (Toxins, Viral Mechanics, Condition Stacking)

## Description  
Where others heal or harm, the Venomancer infects. Whether through volatile poisons, inhaled spores, or parasitic brews, they wear enemies down with patience and purpose. Each hit sows sickness. Each moment of survival becomes a countdown.

This is no longer medical practice.  
This is **ecological warfare**—and you're not the apex predator anymore.
