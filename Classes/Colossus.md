## Role  
Living Fortress / Ultimate Tank (Self-Regen, Mass Knockdowns, Area Control)

## Description  
The Colossus doesnâ€™t flinch.  
Doesnâ€™t stumble.  
Doesnâ€™t retreat.

With the resilience of ancient stone and the force of an unstoppable avalanche, the Colossus dominates the battlefieldâ€”not by speed, not by tricks, but by **being the immovable object**.

You don't avoid a Colossus.  
You get crushed by it.

> **Fear not the blade. Fear the wall behind it.**
