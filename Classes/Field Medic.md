## Description  
The Field Medic is more than just a healer—she’s a survivor hardened by the screams of fallen comrades and the sick irony of battlefield medicine. While others charge, she kneels in blood and makes impossible decisions: save the fighter, or end the suffering.

She works fast, thinks faster, and hides a sharp edge beneath her compassion. In the wastelands of Apocalypso, she’s often the last barrier between a team and total loss.
