Mid-Specialization Advancement

## Role  
Support / Strategic Control (Precognition, Probability Manipulation, Battlefield Mastery)

## Description  
The Oracle bends time and consequence, weaving possibilities into a weapon.  
They see attacks before they are made, counters before they are needed, victories before they are earned. Allies rise under their guiding hand, and enemies crumble under the weight of **their own inevitability**.

The battlefield is not a field of chance.  
It is a script—  
> **And you are the editor.**

**Effect:** At the start of each encounter, choose one visible ally and one enemy.  
- The chosen ally gains **+1 to Saving Throws and Initiative** for the encounter.  
- The chosen enemy suffers **-1 on their Saving Throws** until they damage you or your marked ally.

#### Mastery I (10 uses): *Destined Pivot*  
If the enemy fails a saving throw against you or the marked ally, you can instantly swap their Initiative place with the marked ally.

#### Mastery II (25 uses): *Inevitable End*  
Once per encounter, if the marked enemy falls below 25% HP, force them to **make a WIS save** or be **Stunned** for 1 turn.

### 🟣 Active: **Glimpse the Unwritten** *(always gained)*  
**Type:** 1 Turn  
**Effect:** Glimpse into possible futures.  
- Choose one:  
  - **Insight Surge**: One ally rerolls a failed attack or save, taking the better result.  
  - **Premonition Step**: One ally immediately moves 10 ft without provoking attacks of opportunity.  
**Cost:** 20 Mana

#### Mastery I (10 uses): *Clairvoyant Chain*  
After using Glimpse the Unwritten, you may immediately use a Reaction to let a second nearby ally benefit from the same effect.

### 🟣 Active *(chosen at advancement)*

#### Option A: **Omen Weave** *(Battlefield Setup)*  
**Type:** 1 Turn  
**Effect:** Plant a **future trigger** into the battlefield.  
- Choose a 10 ft area. Until end of next round:  
  - If an enemy enters or ends their turn there, trigger an **Omen Surge**: they must WIS save or take `2d6 + INT` psychic damage and become Slowed for 1 turn.  
**Cost:** 20 Mana

**Mastery I:** *Temporal Spike* – The Surge now causes Disadvantage on next attack roll even if they succeed the save.

**Mastery II:** *Web of Omens* – You can have **two** Omen Weaves active simultaneously.

---

#### Option B: **Rewrite Fate** *(Ally Empowerment / Turn Rescue)*  
**Type:** 1 Reaction  
**Trigger:** An ally within 30 ft fails an attack roll, save, or is critically hit.  
**Effect:** You reach through the fabric of probability.  
- Force a reroll.  
- If the reroll succeeds, the ally gains **+2 AC and +2 to all saves** until end of their next turn.  
**Cost:** 20 Mana

**Mastery I:** *Fate's Shield* – If the reroll is successful, the ally also regains 5 HP.

**Mastery II:** *Destined Champion* – First successful action by the ally after Rewrite Fate deals an additional `1d6` force damage or grants an extra action (move or interact).

## Narrative Hook  
Others fight battles.  
You **write** them.  
Your victory isn't luck.  
> It's **an inevitability only you could foresee.**
