## Class Tier  
2nd Advancement
## Requirements
Must have reached the same level in the Powerpath
## Role  
Chaos Spellcaster / Hex Bearer (Corrupt Magic, Heavy Curse Deployment, Magic Risk Amplifier)

## Description  
The Warlock doesn't simply cast spellsâ€”  
They **command forbidden energies** and **bend them into monstrous forms**.

Their very body flickers with unstable magic.  
Reality bends around them like a dying starâ€™s pull.

Each spell tears at their enemiesâ€”  
and maybe, just maybe, at themselves.

But who cares about the cost when victory is all that remains?

> They gave you powerâ€”and forgot they could never take it back.

## Narrative Hook  
You were never meant to survive the magic.

You werenâ€™t supposed to learn it,  
werenâ€™t supposed to bend it,  
werenâ€™t supposed to **become it**.
