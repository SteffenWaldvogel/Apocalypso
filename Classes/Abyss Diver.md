## Class Tier  
Advanced Tier

## Role  
Assassin / Shadow Manipulator (Teleportation, Reality Distortion, Battlefield Assassination)

## Description  
The Abyss Diver is not just faster.  
They exist where others can only imagineâ€”between places, behind perception, under reality itself.

They flicker between dimensions to unleash deadly strikes and reposition beyond retaliation.  
Where they walk, certainty diesâ€”and fear follows.

**You can't hit what you can't findâ€”  
> And you can't survive what you never saw.**

## Narrative Hook  
The void isn't empty.  
It **calls**, it **hungers**, and it **guides** you.

You are its herald.
