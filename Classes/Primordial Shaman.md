## Class Tier  
Advanced Full Power

## Role  
Elemental Overlord / Primal Conduit (Mega-Environmental Manipulation, Physical and Magic Hybrid)

## Description  
The Primordial Shaman doesnâ€™t cast magic.

They **channel the world**.

Volcanoes pulse in their veins.  
Tsunamis roar in their heartbeats.  
Storms crackle at their breath.

They are the living answer to arroganceâ€”  
the reminder that nature is neither kind nor cruel.  
It simply **is**.

> And now, so are you.

When they poisoned the seas,  
When they mocked the stormsâ€”
