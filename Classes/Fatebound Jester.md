## Class Tier  
Advanced Full Power

## Role  
Avatar of Chaos / Cosmic Fatebender (Reality Corruption, Luck-Based Battlefield Control, Unpredictable Power Surges)

## Description  
The Fatebound Jester is not mortal anymore.

They are the cosmic anomaly,  
the impossible made flesh,  
the distortion that reality regrets allowing to exist.

Every word you speak twists destiny.  
Every step you take bends the lines of causality.

**The world no longer resists you.  
It dances to your mad tune.**

> Win or lose, live or dieâ€”itâ€™s all the same game.  
> And you are the dealer now.

## Narrative Hook  
The world tried to chain fate.  
It tried to leash chaos.  
It tried to define luck.

And it failed.

Because you were already laughing.

> And you will never stop.
