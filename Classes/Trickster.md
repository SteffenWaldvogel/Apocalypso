Supreme Gambler / Reality Cheat (Event Warping, Extreme Probability Control)

A Trickster doesnâ€™t rely on fortune.

Every failure smells suspiciously orchestrated.

Youâ€™re the whisper in the gamblerâ€™s ear,  
the unseen tilt of the dice,  
the cosmic smirk behind every overturned plan.

> You are not *lucky.*  
> You are *inevitable.*
