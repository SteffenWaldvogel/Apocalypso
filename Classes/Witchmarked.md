## Class Tier  
Starter Class

## Role  
Corrupted Magic Initiate / Forbidden Spellcaster (Minor Spells, Corruption Resistance)

## Description  
Witchmarked are not chosen by magicâ€”  
They are **claimed** by it.

Infused with unstable energies, they channel the raw chaos of broken realities into powerful effects, often at the risk of their own bodies.

Each spell is a gamble.  
Each moment is a potential mutation.  
But in that madness lies enormous power.

> In the end, it won't matter whether you sought this fate.  
> **It already seeks you.**

You didn't choose to be marked.  
You simply survived where others withered.

The old powers found you worthyâ€”  
> Or maybe,  
> **they found you delicious.**
