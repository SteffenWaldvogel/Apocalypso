## Class Tier  
1st Advancement

## Role  
Marksman / Tactical Sniper (High-Precision Ranged Combat, Mobility Support)

## Description  
Sharpshooters don't fire wildly.  
They calculate.  
They adapt.  
They **turn distance into dominance**â€”  
Choosing their targets carefully, striking decisively, and moving before anyone knows what happened.

When the battle begins, a Sharpshooter is already where they need to be.  
And youâ€™re already losing.

> **Skill beats strength. Every time.**
