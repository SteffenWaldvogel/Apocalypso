## Class Tier  
Mid-Specialization Advancement

## Role  
Support / Psychological Warfare (Fear, Illusions, Reality Distortion)

## Description  
The Gloomspeaker is no longer content to weave minds.  
They unravel them.

Spreading fear like a contagion and sowing doubt with every whispered thought, they shape battlefields not through violence, but through terror and fractured perception.  
Enemies see threats where there are noneâ€”and worse, they hesitate where it matters most.

but because of what you **let them imagine**.

And imagination can be so... much worse.
