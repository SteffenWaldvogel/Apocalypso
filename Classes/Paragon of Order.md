Absolute Tank / Reality Stabilizer (Total Defense, Immunity Zones, Chaos Suppression)

## Description  
The Paragon of Order is not just a bastionâ€”  
They are **a cosmic principle given flesh**.

Where others see destruction, they see structure.  
Where magic tears, they repair.

You are the last law when all others fail.  
You are the immutable constant.
