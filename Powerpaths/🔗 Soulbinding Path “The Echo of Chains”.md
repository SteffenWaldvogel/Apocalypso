## 🧭 Quest Type
Narrative discovery + mental/spiritual trial  
**Intended Tier:** Early to mid-tier players (Level 5)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Seek out and bind a **Tier 1 Soul Relic** — ancient echoes of lost wills. These relics **do not submit easily**: each tests the user’s will, faith, identity, or control. The quest is a personal, psychological journey.

---

## 🪶 Overview
The system offers a strange choice to the player:  
> _“Your soul is incomplete. Seek what lingers… what watches from behind the veil.”_

A rift appears near the player’s last rest site.  
Stepping through reveals an **Echo Mausoleum** — a fractured plane where relics dwell.

## 🧱 Quest Stages

### 1. The Echo Call
- **Trigger:** After a major emotional decision or death event (e.g., sparing/killing a helpless foe).
- The system creates a “soul fracture” the player can interact with.
- A voice speaks: _“The chains await. Who are you, when no one watches?”_

---

### 2. The Mausoleum of Forgotten Bonds
- The player enters a **semi-illusory pocket realm**, filled with cracked mirrors, whispering walls, and spectral observers.
- They encounter **all Tier 1 relic echoes**, floating and pulsing. Each has a different aura or memory attached.
- The player may walk among them, sense their influence, and choose **any one** to face in trial.

### 3. Relic Trial Room

| Relic | Trial Type | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Whisper Chain | Guilt Trial | Relive a past mistake, and either embrace it or lie. |
| Bone Flute | Command Trial | Lead ghost soldiers in a mini-tactical encounter. |
| Ka’mur’s Gauntlet | Power Trial | Wrestle with a projection of your darker self. |
| Watcher’s Eye | Fate Trial | Guess outcomes of three visions (prophetic puzzles). |
| E’Zhar Shard | Sacrifice Trial | Choose to take a companion’s suffering temporarily. |
| Tenth Lie Tongue | Truth Trial | Be interrogated by an echo. Lying grants power but damages soul. |

---

### 4. The Binding
- After completing a trial, the relic materializes and attempts to enter the user’s soul.

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Success | Full binding; relic functions as designed. |
| ✅ DC+5 | Bonus effect or reduced drawback. |
| ❌ Fail | Relic binds partially; enhanced drawback. |
