## 🧭 Quest Type
Mutation origin event + anomaly encounter  
**Intended Tier:** Early to mid-tier players (Level 5)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Trigger a **void-based mutation event** and complete a ritual of exposure to bind one Tier 1 Echo Mutation into your body.

The path centers on **voluntary exposure to anomalous zones** and surviving the resulting **mutation surge**. You don’t *find* the mutation — it *finds and rewrites* you.

---

## 🪶 Overview
The system doesn’t offer this path directly.

Instead, the player begins to see glitching visual hallucinations after entering a corrupted area.  
A moment of stillness is interrupted by:

> _“Do you still belong to what you were?”_  
> _“Say yes, and survive. Say no, and reshape thy flesh.”_

## 🧱 Quest Stages

### 1. Echo Instability Event
- **Trigger:** After staying too long in a corrupted zone, or defeating a void-touched creature.
- Player suffers **1 level of exhaustion** and begins hallucinating.
- System overlay appears with shifting glyphs — a "mutation seed" enters their bloodstream.

---

### 2. Exposure Site: The Cradle of Dissonance
- A **living anomaly zone** — semi-breathing cave of humming crystal and tendrils.
- Inside: Pulses of void-light offer **six different Echo Nodes** (the Tier 1 mutations).
- Player may approach one and must resist the others calling to them (WIS Save).

---

### 3. Mutation Integration
- The chosen node activates.
- A vision triggers, and the player is pulled into their own body’s void-shadow.

> _“You see your limbs fragment into symbols. One speaks: ‘You are soft. Let us make you hard.’”_

- Player rolls **Integration Check** (per mutation).

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Success | Mutation integrates as described. |
| ✅ DC+5 | Mutation improves (cooldown lowered or drawback softened). |
| ❌ Fail | Mutation triggers early. Player suffers drawback in first use. |
| ❌ Nat 1 | Mutation is unstable: physical deformity or permanent RP cost added. |

## ⚠️ Optional: Mutation Surge
- When mutation is first used in combat:

    - DM describes extra uncontrolled effect (visual glitch, corrupted flesh growth)
