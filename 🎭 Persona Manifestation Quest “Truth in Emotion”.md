## üß≠ Quest Type
Roleplay milestone + emotional trigger  
**Intended Tier:** Early to mid-tier players (Level 5)

---

## üéØ Objective
Unlock deep emotional powers that define the player‚Äôs **true identity**, hidden strengths, and buried vulnerabilities.  
Each player chooses a **Strong Suit Emotion** and a **Weak Suit Emotion** ‚Äî the rest remain available at their **Basic level**.

---

## ü™∂ Overview
This path **does not appear via the system**.  
Instead, during moments of intense emotion ‚Äî betrayal, despair, victory, hope ‚Äî the system freezes.  
A whisper follows:

> _‚ÄúThis... is you. Let it be known.‚Äù_

The player sees a glowing **emotional sigil** manifesting from their core.

## üß± Quest Structure

### 1. Emotional Threshold
- **Trigger:** When the player‚Äôs actions, choices, or roleplay reflect **a powerful emotional commitment**, the world distorts briefly.
- Nearby NPCs may pause, voices may echo backward, and the player's soul is "seen."

---

### 2. Soul Sigil Revelation
- The player is confronted with a **mental/emotional mirror**, showing the 12 emotions.
- They choose:
  - **Strong Suit Emotion**: Grants access to its **Empowered Ability**
  - **Weak Suit Emotion**: Will manifest unpredictably under stress (triggers **Weakness Effect** automatically on fails)

---

### 3. Emotion Sync Check
Each time an Empowered or Weak Suit effect is activated, the player makes an **Emotion Sync Save** (WIS or CHA, DC = 10 + uses that day).  
Failure means:
- Overwhelmed by emotion
- Roleplay consequence
- Weakened version of ability triggers instead
